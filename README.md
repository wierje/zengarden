The Zen Garden Challenge

Visit http://www.csszengarden.com/ and explore some of the designs.

You will create your own version of the CSS Zen Garden. Download the HTML and CSS files from the site. The only rule: you may only change the CSS; not the HTML.

Setup

Run the following command in your terminal:

mkdir -p ~/workspace/exercises/the-static-web/zengarden && cd $_
This will create a project folder and cd you into it.

Once your repository is created on GitHub, copy the list of commands under "..or create a new repository on the command line" by clicking on the clipboard icon
Paste the commands into your terminal. This will create a README.md file, add it, commit it, connect your local repo to GitHub, and set you up to push up the changes. (If the last command, git push origin master isn't automatically executed, hit enter/return to run it).
All of your work should be on a branch, NOT on master. To do this, type:

git checkout -b exercise
touch index.html
touch style.css
mkdir images
You are now ready to work in the exercise branch.

When your work is complete, push up the branch (git push origin exercise) and submit the pull request on Github.

Note: In an effort to keep this project like the Zen Garden website, this exercise does not have a styles folder.
